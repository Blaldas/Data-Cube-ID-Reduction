# Internship: Data Cube ID Reduction

This repository is used as an archive for all the projects that I will create during my internship at CISUC.
By the ending of the interneship a new repo will be created with CiiCube's algorithm

As it can be seen, multiple implementations where done.
The Frag-Cubing implementation used as comparison to CiiCube can be found [here](/Project%204/src/notUsingFastUtil).

The interneship theses can be found [here](/MarcoDomingues_2018013362_RelatoÃÅrioEstagio.pdf) (in portuguese).

The final grade obtained was 19 (1-20).

The final version of CiiCube can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/Blaldas/CiiCube).
