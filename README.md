# Internship: Data Cube ID Reduction

This repository is used as an archive for all the projects that I will create during my internship at CISUC.
By the ending of the interneship a new repo will be created with CiiCube's algorithm

As it can be seen, multiple implementations where done.
The Frag-Cubing implementation used as comparison to CiiCube can be found [here](/Internship-Data-Cube-ID-Reduction/Project 4/src/notUsingFastUtil/).
