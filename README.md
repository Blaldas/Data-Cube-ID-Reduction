# Internship: Data Cube ID Reduction

This repository is used as an archive for all the projects that I will create during my internship at CISUC.

project 1 was an very early testing and implementation

project 2 was to be the final project, however, due to the fact that the architecture of the program is different from the original and, therefore, it is not possible to have the exact same output and not being able to compare both programs performance, it was finished.

project 3 it is made with the same algorithm, so I hope it will not be finished for some pathetic reason.
